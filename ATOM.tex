\section{Study 2. Can Children's Verbal Use Explain Pronoun Case Errors? }
\subsection{ATOM Model}
Researchers have provided a wide range of explanations for pronoun case errors. From a theoretical perspective, pronoun case errors occur when the children fail to check both tense and agreement in their utterances according the to Agreement/Tense Omission Model (\textsc{atom}) \citep{wexler1998,wexler1998}. They argue that children clearly know the case system at an early age. However, children experience an Optional Infinitive stage \citep{wexler1994}, during which children produce utterances omitting inflections and with fully inflected forms at the same time. Although the theory didn't further explain why would children knowingly omit some inflections at this stage, they do believe that the errors in pronoun case in children's utterances don't reflect their impaired knowledge of the case system. They observations of the data:
\begin{exe}
\ex Non-NOM subject errors > NOM-ACC object errors 
\ex NOM subjects all with INFL, Non-NOM subjects - some have INFL some don'
\end{exe}

The ATOM model is built based on some crucial theoretical assumptions. First, they assume that the case manifests on pronouns is the result of structural licensing instead of morphological case marking, which makes pronoun case a syntactical problem but not a lexical problem. Second, they assume that the nominative case is assigned/licensed by the Agreement (\textsc{arg}), not Tense (\textsc{tns}). Moreover, they assume that Tense and Agreement are separated that they operate independently from each other \citep{chomsky1993minimalist}. 

Based on their assumptions, in order to produce a sentence with the correct case and verb inflections, the child needs to have knowledge of Agreement and Tense. More specifically, they understand the \textsc{tns} feature has to be realized on the verb and that the presence of inflection requires the nominative case to be assigned to the subject. \cite{wexler1994,wexler1996,wexler1998,wexler2000} argued that although young children produce many utterances without proper inflections, they do have the knowledge of Tense, because they experience an Optional Infinitive stage, during which they produce utterances omitting inflections and with fully inflected forms at the same time. Now the question is about children's knowledge of Agreement. The \textsc{+agr} feature can assign a nominative case on pronoun as well as trigger agreement on the verb and auxiliaries. 
Therefore, there are two \textsc{+agr} features (one realized on the pronoun, one realilzed on the verb) and they don't necessarily agree with each other:


There are four configuration:

\subsection{Methods}
In \cite{schutze1996subject}, they used data of three children (Nina, Peter and Sarah) in CHILDES. They included the all the files that have non-NOM subject, which results in 31 files for Nina (1;11 - 2;5), 9 files for Peter (1;11 - 2;5) and 21 files for Sarah (2;8 - 3;1). They only counted finite and non-finite INFL forms occurring with the pronoun, thus ignoring utterances like \textit{I go} or \textit{me go}. In their study, finite verb types include auxiliary, modal, copula and past tense; null auxiliary and null copula are considered INFL. They also excluded full or partial imitations, self-repetitions, clearly rote or formulaic expressions and instances where the utterances plus the situation did not make it clear what the intended subject was. 
In the early cases of all the three children, they all have utterances demonstrating that they know that the accusative case is the default case. For example, all three children used the accusative case in the elliptical answers such as (\ref{elip}), and none of the nominative case has appeared in such environment.
\begin{exe}
\ex \label{elip} Mother: Who's going to eat with a big spoon?\\
Nina: Me!
\end{exe}
They counted all the finite verbs and non-finite verbs occurring with first person singular pronouns (\textit{I, me, my}) and third person singular pronouns (\textit{he, she, him, her}). The results of their study is shown in table\ref{tab:ATOMSchutze}.

As shown in the table, for Nina, Peter and Sarah, their non-nominative case pronouns occur with non-finite verbs more frequent than finite verbs, which provides evidence for the ATOM hypothesis. Based on these three children's data, they also made some generalizations:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item non-nominative subjects almost never co-occur with inflection, except for occational past-tense;
\item The non-nominative subjects with past tense form is a real grammatical possibility for the child instead of a performance error
\item Nominative subjects also co-occur with verbs without inflections
\item non-nominative subjects can be both ACC and GEN for the same age roughly equal porportions, not conditioned by verb types
\item GEN subjects represent a real grammatical error 
\item Children exhibiting those errors reliably know the correct use of ACC and GEN forms 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{My methodology}
In order to, \%gra tier is used to search for the verbs. Untensed verbs are tagged as \textit{'v'} or \textit{'v-root'}. Verbs with INFL are tagged detailely in the \% tier. Next table showed a breakdown of the verb types following each pronoun. 
Auxililaries include any tags that include \textit{'aux'}. Modals include any tags that include \textit{'mod}. Copulas include any tags that include \textit{'cop'}. Past tense verbs include verbs that have been tagged with \textit{'-PAST'}. Null Auxiliary include negation marker such as \textit{'not'}, which is tagged as \textit{'neg'}; progressive and perfective forms of the verb, which is tagged as \textit{'part'}. Null Copula include adjectives, adverbs and prepositions \footnote{The adverb \textit{'too'} is not counted.}. Nouns are not included in Null Copula because Nouns are more suitable to count for GEN errors. 
My data:
In appendix. 
    

\subsection{Challenges from \cite{pine2005testing}}
\cite{pine2005testing} argued that his testing method is flawed. The low rate of \textit{ACC + INFL} might be a false low rate beacuse it should be compared to a chi-squred expected rate instead of standing alone. \\
